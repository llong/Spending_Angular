Conversion of my Rails Spending App to AngularJS/Firebase


This app uses AngularJS on the front end to communicate with a Firebase DB. I'm building this app to push my 
AngularJS skills by rebuilding an App I created with Ruby on Rails months ago.


At the moment new items can be added to each persons list using Firebase as well as being removed from the DB. Items are sorted by most recently added.

Things to do:

- Display dates in a friendly manner
done - Get total amount spent by each user and calculate remaining balance
- add option to update existing items
- Make app prettier
